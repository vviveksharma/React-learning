## Learning from this 
- We can use ` to add the dynamic value inside the api urls.
- If we want to make a State variable as null, then we can `?` to access the information if only not null
```bash
const [age, setAge] = useState(null);
- If we access the age?.name (In this the age name value will only be printed if that value is not null)
```
